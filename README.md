# Content Based Recommendation Engine in AEM

Recommendation Engine which generates the content based recommendations in AEM. 
It performs the consine similarity on features extracted from data collected from JCR based on properties provided as 
configuration.

## Modules

The main parts of the template are:

* core: Java bundle containing all core functionality like OSGi services, listeners or schedulers, as well as component-related Java code such as servlets or request filters.
* ui.apps: contains the /apps (and /etc) parts of the project, ie JS&CSS clientlibs, components, templates, runmode specific configs as well as Hobbes-tests
* ui.content: contains sample content using the components from the ui.apps
* ui.tests: Java bundle containing JUnit tests that are executed server-side. This bundle is not to be deployed onto production.
* ui.launcher: contains glue code that deploys the ui.tests bundle (and dependent bundles) to the server and triggers the remote JUnit execution

## How to build

To build all the modules run in the project root directory the following command with Maven 3:

    mvn clean install

If you have a running AEM instance you can build and package the whole project and deploy into AEM with

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage

Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackagePublish

Or alternatively

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage -Daem.port=4503

Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle

## Testing

There are three levels of testing contained in the project:

* unit test in core: this show-cases classic unit testing of the code contained in the bundle. To test, execute:

    mvn clean test
